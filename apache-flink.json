    "desc": "Apache Flink (formerly called Stratosphere) features powerful programming abstractions in Java and Scala, a high-performance runtime, and automatic program optimization. It has native support for iterations, incremental iterations, and programs consisting of large DAGs of operations. Flink is a data processing system and an alternative to Hadoop's MapReduce component. It comes with its own runtime, rather than building on top of MapReduce. As such, it can work completely independently of the Hadoop ecosystem. However, Flink can also access Hadoop's distributed file system (HDFS) to read and write data, and Hadoop's next-generation resource manager (YARN) to provision cluster resources. Since most Flink users are using Hadoop HDFS to store their data, it ships already the required libraries to access HDFS. "
