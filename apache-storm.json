    "desc":"Storm is a complex event processor (CEP) and distributed computation framework written predominantly in the Clojure programming language. Is a distributed real-time computation system for processing fast, large streams of data. Storm is an architecture based on master-workers paradigma. So a Storm cluster mainly consists of a master and worker nodes, with coordination done by Zookeeper. Storm makes use of zeromq (0mq, zeromq), an advanced, embeddable networking library. It provides a message queue, but unlike message-oriented middleware (MOM), a 0MQ system can run without a dedicated message broker. The library is designed to have a familiar socket-style API. Originally created by Nathan Marz and team at BackType, the project was open sourced after being acquired by Twitter. Storm was initially developed and deployed at BackType in 2011. After 7 months of development BackType was acquired by Twitter in July 2011. Storm was open sourced in September 2011. Hortonworks is developing a Storm-on-YARN version and plans finish the base-level integration in 2013 Q4. This is the plan from Hortonworks. Yahoo/Hortonworks also plans to move Storm-on-YARN code from github.com/yahoo/storm-yarn to be a subproject of Apache Storm project in the near future. Twitter has recently released a Hadoop-Storm Hybrid called “Summingbird.” Summingbird fuses the two frameworks into one, allowing for developers to use Storm for short-term processing and Hadoop for deep data dives,. a system that aims to mitigate the tradeoffs between batch processing and stream processing by combining them into a hybrid system.
